# Super-Fresh
A 3D Collect and Serve game, created for CE818 module

Super Fresh is a collect and serve game, where your goal is to collect fruit as fast as possible and serve it to customers, the quicker you are the higher your score will be.

I submitted Super Fresh as the final assignment in the module CE818 (High Level Games Development),  this is part of my MSc in Game Development at the University of Essex in 2021-2022, although I did all the coding, some of its visual/audio assets are not mine and are as follows:
